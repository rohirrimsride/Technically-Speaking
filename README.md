  # Technically Speaking

  ## Description
  Technically Speaking is in the process of a directional shift.  It currently serves as a tech blog for users to post tech/coding related thoughts to share with other users.  However, to make this more useful to myself and hopefully others, I plan to pivot toward it being more of a vault for storing tech articles that I've found helpful and want to come back to, along with a short description or thoughts related to the content of the article.  Eventually I'm hoping to turn it into an installable app using Deta Space to host it.

  ## Installation
  Pull the repository; Install the npm dependencies; Create a .env file with a DB_NAME and your DB_USER, DB_PW; In server.js change sequelize.sync force to true to create your database; turn off the server and change it back to false; run 'node seeds/index.js' to seed the database; Run 'npm start' again in the database to run the app.

  ## Usage
  Once the app is running you can create an account and start writing posts.

  ## Contribute
  There is a single post view that can use some work.
